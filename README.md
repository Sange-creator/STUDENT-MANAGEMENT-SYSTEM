# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Student structure

First we create a structure to store student data.

struct Student{
	int rollnumber;
	char name[100];
	char phone[100];
	float percentage;
	struct Student *next;
}*head;
head is a global pointer of type Student which will point to the first node in the linked list. The advantage of declaring head global is we can directly use it in any function without passing it as a parameter.

Insert Function

After that, we create a function insert, that will add a new node to the linked list. The insert function accepts student details as an argument. It creates a new node with the student details passed to the function and then inserts the new node at the beginning of the linked list.

void insert(int rollnumber, char* name, char* phone, float percentage)
{
	
    struct Student * student = (struct Student *) malloc(sizeof(struct Student));
	student->rollnumber = rollnumber;
	strcpy(student->name, name);
	strcpy(student->phone, phone);
	student->percentage = percentage;
	student->next = NULL;
	
	if(head==NULL){
		// if head is NULL
		// set student as the new head
		head = student;
	}
	else{
		// if list is not empty
		// insert student in beginning of head
		student->next = head;
		head = student;
	}
	
}
Search Function

The search function searches the record based on the roll number. The search function accepts 1 parameter that is the roll number of the student we want to search. The function traverses all the nodes of the linked list to find the required record.

void search(int rollnumber)
{
    struct Student * temp = head;
	while(temp!=NULL){
		if(temp->rollnumber==rollnumber){
			printf("Roll Number: %d\n", temp->rollnumber);
			printf("Name: %s\n", temp->name);
			printf("Phone: %s\n", temp->phone);
			printf("Percentage: %0.4f\n", temp->percentage);
			return;
		}
		temp = temp->next;
	}
	printf("Student with roll number %d is not found !!!\n", rollnumber);
}
Update Function

The update function first searches for the node with the required roll number. If the node is found, the program asks the user to enter new updated values.

void update(int rollnumber)
{
	
    struct Student * temp = head;
	while(temp!=NULL){
		
		if(temp->rollnumber==rollnumber){
			printf("Record with roll number %d Found !!!\n", rollnumber);
			printf("Enter new name: ");
			scanf("%s", temp->name);
			printf("Enter new phone number: ");
			scanf("%s", temp->phone);
			printf("Enter new percentage: ");
			scanf("%f",&temp->percentage);
			printf("Updation Successful!!!\n");
			return;
		}
		temp = temp->next;
		
	}
	printf("Student with roll number %d is not found !!!\n", rollnumber);
	
}
Delete Function

Delete works similar to search. We search for the record by itâ€™s roll number. If the record is found, we delete it from the linked list.

void Delete(int rollnumber)
{

    struct Student * temp1 = head;
	struct Student * temp2 = head; 
	while(temp1!=NULL){
		
		if(temp1->rollnumber==rollnumber){
			
			printf("Record with roll number %d Found !!!\n", rollnumber);
			
			if(temp1==temp2){
				// this condition will run if
				// the record that we need to delete is the first node
				// of the linked list
				head = head->next;
				free(temp1);
			}
			else{
				// temp1 is the node we need to delete
				// temp2 is the node previous to temp1
				temp2->next = temp1->next;
				free(temp1); 
			}
			
			printf("Record Successfully Deleted !!!\n");
			return;
			
		}
		temp2 = temp1;
		temp1 = temp1->next;
		
	}
	printf("Student with roll number %d is not found !!!\n", rollnumber);
	
}
Display Function

Display function traverse the linked list and print all the details of each node of the linked list.

void display()
{
    struct Student * temp = head;
	while(temp!=NULL){
		
		printf("Roll Number: %d\n", temp->rollnumber);
		printf("Name: %s\n", temp->name);
		printf("Phone: %s\n", temp->phone);
		printf("Percentage: %0.4f\n\n", temp->percentage);
		temp = temp->next;
		
	}
}
